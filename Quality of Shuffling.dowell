Input 15 series qualified after Central Limit Theorem test.
Test the Normality of each series.
Find first moment i.e. mean.
Find second central moment i.e. variance.
Find third moment and hence skewness.
Find fourth moment and hence kurtosis.
Check whether kurtosis is above than 3.
Select the series for assignment.
